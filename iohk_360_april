IOHK TownHall
    Vasil Hardfork (tentatively 29June) will include:
        CIP-31: Reference Inputs
        CIP-32: Inline Datums
        CIP-33: Reference Scripts
        CIP-40: Collateral Outputs (only collateral required is included)
        Two best ways to understand these CIPs:

        Core Interpreter:
            script size will be 20% smaller
            redemeers 40% faster
            non-evaluation processing runs 80% faster
    Cardano Foundation Initiatives:
        Partner with U. of Zurick with summer school and research program
        Hired community managers. 5 more marketing roles open.
        Condo" Open source veteran driving governance future of cardano
        veritree - 500k trees
        consensus - 50x20ft booth. and community event on 8th, night before main event (virtual and onsite)
    Ecosystem Growth - Morgan Schofield IOG interviews Milkomeda and WanChain
        Milkomeda - Current limited functionality bridge ada to milkada, and support for some tokens
            Currently a side chain, looking to move to L2 solution, which allows leveraging security of Cardano.
                Probably not full deployment this year, but plan to make a lot of progress.
            Working on more core functionality
                Deployment of many protocols (such as thegraph and much more)
                Looking to add NFT bridging functionality
        WanChain - Dr Zhang
            Will allow asssets in other chains to transfer to Cardano, and vice versa
            Assets will be interoperable. Eth, WADA, NFTs foor some examples.
            Key point made here about challenges. Other than the obvious language differences in other chains, you also have the cryptography.
                EdDSA and ed25529. support for Secp256k1 used by bitcoin coming in hardfork
        Kathryn Stacy - IOHK Product Marketer
            EVM Sidechains (Programmability, Interoperability, Scalability) - Research Tab on the IOHK website
                Makes it easier for Solidity developers to deploy on Cardano    
                Sidechain is a very secure way of adding functionality to the chain, by reducing complex additions to core
                Standalone Testnet > Passive Sidechain > Active Sidechain > Mainchain Deployment

        Ton of testing and progress being made on Vasil Hardfork
    Matthew Capps talk with Sundaeswap (Pi) and Orbis (Ryan Matovu)
        Talk mainly was a general discussion of eUTXO
        Sundaeaswap working on V2 of their App
        Orbis - L2 Zero knowledge proof scaling solution using ZK-Rollups
            ZK Rollups - are ofcryptography around since 80s. Able to proof something to someone without giving up the data itself
                Submitted to cardano mainchain and proves offchain transaction is what it says it is
    Coti - Djed Progress
        djed.xyz website
        25 projects already signed for partnerships
        Private testnet live, and coming days the public testnet should be available
        Next step is then to do the audit
        Then next step is for June/July to be main release
        Djed = stablecoin, Shen = reserve coin ... need when dealing with algorithmic stablecoins
